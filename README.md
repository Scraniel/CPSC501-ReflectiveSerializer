# CPSC501-ReflectiveSerializer
An object serializer / deserializer that operates on arbitrary objects using reflection.

It is made up of 2 programs, the sender (which serializes data) and the receiver (which deserializes data). They are meant to be run on 2 separate computers so as to show that the data is sent accross a network.
